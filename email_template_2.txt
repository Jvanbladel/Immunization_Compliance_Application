Dear ${PERSON_NAME}, 

This is a follow up email.

The flu can lead to fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, fatigue,
and more. Preteens and teens should get the flu vaccine every year,
ideally by October, but vaccination can continue through January or
even later.

Please contact our office to schedule your appointment today. When you call,
we can discuss the vaccinations that may be needed at this visit based on your
medical records. In the meantime, for more information you can visit
www.cdc.gov/vaccines.

Thank you and we look forward to hearing from you.
Have a great weekend! 

Yours Truly
