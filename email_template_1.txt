Hello ${PERSON_NAME},

Now is the time to get a flu vaccine! In the U.S., millions of people get sick, hundreds of thousands are
hospitalized, and thousands or tens of thousands of people die from flu every year. Every flu season is
different, and flu vaccine can vary in how well it works, but receiving a flu vaccine every year offers the
best available protection against flu and has been shown to reduce illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths
in children.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone ages 6 months and
older receive a flu vaccine every year.

Some people who get a flu vaccine may still get flu, but remember that vaccination may make illness
milder if you do get sick. Schedule your flu vaccine appointment today or call our office at 209-946-2285
if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Jason VanBladel, MD.
